It includes features covering customer information, invoice details, track metadata, artist names, genres, media types, geographic data and calculated revenue for each transaction.\n",

        "  * **Quality :**\n",
        "    After preprocessing, duplicate records were removed and inconsistencies in column naming, formatting and categorical values (such as country and genre names) were standardized. A calculated column (*Total_Amount = Unit_Price × Quantity*) was created to support revenue analysis, resulting in a clean and structured dataset suitable for advanced analytics.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Missing Data :**\n",
        "    Minor missing values were observed in certain optional fields (such as customer state or company). These were either handled through appropriate imputation techniques or retained as “Unknown” where necessary, ensuring dataset completeness and analytical reliability.\n",

        "    The dataset contains both numerical variables (Unit_Price, Quantity, Total_Amount) and categorical variables (Genre_Name, Artist_Name, Album_Title, Country, City, Media_Type). It also includes a datetime variable (Invoice_Date) for time-based trend analysis.\n",

        "\n",
        "  * **Sales Patterns :**\n",
        "    Revenue is highly concentrated among specific genres and top-performing artists. A small percentage of customers contribute a large share of total sales, reflecting the Pareto Principle. Repeat customers tend to generate significantly higher lifetime value.\n",
        "\n",

Through systematic data cleaning, SQL-based structuring, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and multiple visualization techniques, meaningful patterns and business relationships were identified.\n",

        "The analysis confirmed that **purchase quantity, genre popularity, and artist performance significantly influence total revenue generation**. Geographic sales patterns revealed that **specific countries and cities dominate overall revenue**, while genre–region combinations strongly impact purchasing behavior. Additionally, the platform exhibits a **revenue concentration structure**, where a small percentage of customers, artists and albums contribute disproportionately to total sales.\n",

        "By leveraging these insights, Apple iTunes can make data-driven decisions in content promotion, customer segmentation, regional marketing strategies, pricing optimization and revenue forecasting. The findings support improved customer retention strategies, optimized marketing resource allocation, risk reduction through diversification and sustainable long-term profitability.\n",
